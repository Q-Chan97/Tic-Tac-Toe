# Tic-Tac-Toe

This was a tic-tac-toe project, meant to showcase my understanding of factory functions and the module pattern of organizing Javascript.

The module pattern has been fairly straightforward in how it works, and I like how it contains different bits of code so you can pull what code you need when you need it.

It was a fun project, but there were some features that I didn't have enough time to include, like custom player names and a system for winning the game based on rounds. 
I might come back to this one in the future!
